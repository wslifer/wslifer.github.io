            My name is Wesley Eric Slifer and I am a web developer always in
            training. I currently am enrolled in the KU Coding Bootcamp Cohort
            of August 2020.

            I am a self-driven, motivated, hard worker who is always excited to
            work as part of a team. Throughout my life thus far I have dipped
            into several fields of work in order to find my fit. After
            contemplating what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I
            realized that I have always loved computers and anything to do with
            them. I then decided I wanted to live by the saying 'If you love
            what you do, you will never work a day in your life.'

            When I enrolled in the coding bootcamp I knew very little about
            coding, and everything I knew was self taught. After working hard
            throughout the class I was able to learn what it takes to be a
            full-stack web developer. Another key skill I learned from the
            bootcamp was how to further my education in the world of
            programming. Due to the ever changing world of technology, I feel
            that it is a very important trade to be able to continue learning.

          <Typography variant="body1" className={style.textArea}>
            As a now full-stack web developer I have experience in using many
            different technologies to create useful web applications. The
            technologies that I have become proficient in at this time include,
            but are not limited to: Front-end: HTML, CSS and Javascript;
            Back-end: MySql and MongoDB; and libraries: ReactJS and MaterialUI.
